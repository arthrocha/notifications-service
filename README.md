This project is designed to demonstrate the principles of SOLID and DDD (Domain-Driven Design) in action. It was developed in the classes of RocketSeat's Ignite Lab project. The project used the Nestjs, which is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It is built on top of Express.js and makes use of modern JavaScript features, such as async/await.

SOLID is an acronym that stands for the following five principles of object-oriented programming:

1-Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.

2-Open-Closed Principle (OCP): A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3-Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.

4-Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't use.

5-Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.

DDD is an approach to software development that focuses on modeling the domain of the problem you're trying to solve. It encourages you to think about the problem from the perspective of the business or domain experts and to create a model that accurately reflects their understanding of the problem. The main concepts of DDD are:

1-Domain: The specific area of knowledge or activity to which the software applies

2-Model: A representation of the domain in the form of classes, interfaces, and other constructs

3-Domain Events: Events that happen inside the domain.

4-Bounded Context: A boundary that defines a specific domain model and its relationships with other models.

5-Entity: Classes that represent unique things in the domain.

6-Value Objects: Classes that represent non-unique things in the domain.

7-Services: Classes that represent actions that can be performed on the domain model.

8-Repositories: Classes that manage the persistence of domain objects
